## Player
X is an explorer searching for new, habitable planets. During cryo he encountered a black hole. The gravity propelled his ship past light speed sending him back in time.

## Level 2
X gets propelled forward in time to around 1280 in some northern country. They’ll come upon other humans for the first time.

X will have three kinds of encounters throughout the map:


* Vikings(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 20 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.


* Nords(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 10 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.
If the translator is in the inventory however there will be a short text of him greeting them and them offering X some food. This will instead give +10 to X’s health. This will only happen once/Nord


* Water(5): Static puddles of water. If the analyzer is carried they’ll have a 50% chance of adding +5 to X’s health and sanity once.
“This water is refreshing”
Else they have a 50% chance of damaging X’s health by 5 once prompting.
“This water tastes rotten”
