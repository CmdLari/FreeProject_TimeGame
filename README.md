# Going Home

## Items

## Portal
Prompts a message: *"This seems to lead me forwards and back to my time. Do I already want to enter? [Y/N]"* **Leads to next lvl** Upon being used creates a save file with current stats and next level as placement.

## Player
X is an explorer searching for new, habitable planets. During cryo he encountered a black hole. The gravity propelled his ship past light speed sending him back in time.

## Level 1
X wakes up in prehistoric times with no memory after surviving the crash by sheer luck.
Finding his ship nearby he realizes there might be clues hidden in the debris.

### **X starting stats in Lvl 1:**
**Health: 20**

**Sanity: 20**

**Rationality: 0**

**Love: 0**

* **The ship:** prompts a message that it might be advantageous to take a look around: *“This debris is all that remains of a crashed vessel. I might want to take a look around to find out more”*

X can find up to 15 lost items, offering either technical help or memories:


* **1 The Analyzer:** An item scanning and determining the viability of nearby food or water *“This item will help me find viable nourishment and avoid poisoning myself”* If X carries this, the berries in the first map will become visible. The analyzer will give **+10 Rationality**


* **2 The Diary:** X old diary will tell them that they had a partner where they came from and were searching for habitable planets.
“My old diary: I was an explorer? Seems like I was looking for habitable planets. And I’m writing about a partner I’m missing… I wonder how they are…” The diary will give X **+10 Love** 


* **3 The Translator:** A device able to translate foreign languages both ways. *“This is a translator. It might come in handy, if I ever encounter another human being!”* The translator will give **+10 Rationality**


* **4 A Picture/Video log:** This will tell the player more about their partner and how happy they were. **+20 Love**

* **5 Armour:** This will reduce the damage of any enemy by 5

* **6 Rations:** This will give **+10 Health** each time the player enters a new level.

X will have two kinds of encounters throughout the map:


* **Dinosaurs(10):** They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 10 when colliding. They will also cost him 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn. **-10 Health** **-5 Sanity**


* **Berries(10):** Berries will become active if the Analyzer is in the inventory and will each add **+10 to Health** once


Level 1 will finish upon finding the portal.
Text will spawn on screen depending on the carried items. Giving a small rewind of whatever X found / His current stats.
If X dies, the game will be over spawning an according message plus the same inventory related quotes.

### **X stats at the end of Lvl 1:**
**Health: 0 -**

**Sanity: 0 -**

**Rationality: 0 -**

**Love: 0 -**

### **Possible ends:**

## Level 2
X gets propelled forward in time to around 1280 in some northern country. They’ll come upon other humans for the first time.

X will have three kinds of encounters throughout the map:


* Vikings(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 20 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.


* Nords(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 10 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.
If the translator is in the inventory however there will be a short text of him greeting them and them offering X some food. This will instead give +10 to X’s health. This will only happen once/Nord


* Water(5): Static puddles of water. If the analyzer is carried they’ll have a 50% chance of adding +5 to X’s health and sanity once.
“This water is refreshing”
Else they have a 50% chance of damaging X’s health by 5 once prompting.
“This water tastes rotten”
