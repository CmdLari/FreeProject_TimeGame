# Going Home
## Player
X is an explorer searching for new, habitable planets. During cryo he encountered a black hole. The gravity propelled his ship past light speed sending him back in time.

## Level 1
X wakes up in prehistoric times with no memory after surviving the crash by sheer luck.
Finding his ship nearby he realizes there might be clues hidden in the debris.

X starting stats in Lvl 1:
Health: 20
Sanity: 20
Rationality: 0
Love: 0

The ship: prompts a message that it might be advantageous to take a look around:
“This debris is all that remains of a crashed vessel. I might want to take a look around to find out more”

X can find up to 15 lost items, offering either technical help or memories:


* The Analyzer: An item scanning and determining the viability of nearby food or water
“This item will help me find viable nourishment and avoid poisoning myself”
If X carries this, the berries in the first map will become visible.
The analyzer will give +10 to rationality


* The Diary: X old diary will tell them that they had a partner where they came from and were searching for habitable planets.
“My old diary: I was an explorer? Seems like I was looking for habitable planets. And I’m writing about a partner I’m missing… I wonder how they are…”
The diary will give X +10 to “Love” while in the inventory and +5 for finding it


* The Translator: A device able to translate foreign languages both ways.
“This is a translator. It might come in handy, if I ever encounter another human being!” 
The translator will give +10 to rationality


* …

X will have two kinds of encounters throughout the map:


Dinosaurs(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 10 when colliding. They will also cost him 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.


Berries(10): Berries will become active if the Analyzer is in the inventory and will each add 10 to X’s health once


Level 1 will finish upon finding the portal.
Text will spawn on screen depending on the carried items. Giving a small rewind of whatever X found / His current stats.
If X dies, the game will be over spawning an according message plus the same inventory related quotes.

Level 2
X gets propelled forward in time to around 1280 in some northern country. They’ll come upon other humans for the first time.

X will have three kinds of encounters throughout the map:


Vikings(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 20 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.


Nords(10): They move randomly across the map and will damage X’s health by 10 when colliding. They will also cost them 5 sanity. They can not be killed and don’t despawn.
If the translator is in the inventory however there will be a short text of him greeting them and them offering X some food. This will instead give +10 to X’s health. This will only happen once/Nord


Water(5): Static puddles of water. If the analyzer is carried they’ll have a 50% chance of adding +5 to X’s health and sanity once.
“This water is refreshing”
Else they have a 50% chance of damaging X’s health by 5 once prompting.
“This water tastes rotten”
